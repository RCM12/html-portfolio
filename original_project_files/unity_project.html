      <h2>Paddle Ninja: A 2D Breakout-Style Game With Controller Support</h2>
      <p>
        Paddle Ninja is a 2D Breakout-style game in which the player controls a paddle and attempts to break bricks with one or more
        endlessly-moving steel balls. I created it using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I plan to add more features to the
        game in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its current stage, the game consists of the following features:<br>
        <ul class="game-features">
          <li>A variety of screens including a main menu, an options menu, and a progress menu</li>
          <li>Eight different collectibles, which appear with a random chance upon breaking a brick and alter one of the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The behavior of the ball(s) currently in play</li>
            <li>The player-controlled paddle</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Five different brick types, each with varying strength and difficulty to break, one of which is unbreakable and does not count towards
            a level's brick count</li>
          <li>A total of five heart containers per level, each representing one player life; the player starts with three at the beginning of each level
            but can gain (or lose!) more by collecting life-related collectibles</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I created original sprites for the ball, paddle, bricks, hearts (player lives), and collectibles. I enjoyed being able to mesh programming and pixel
        art into an original game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been passionate about game design for as long as I can remember. I felt that creating this game would help me gain a better understanding
        of the game development process and object-oriented programming.
