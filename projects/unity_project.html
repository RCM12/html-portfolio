    <h2>Paddle Ninja: A 2D Breakout-Style Game With Controller Support</h2>
    <p>
      Paddle Ninja is a 2D Breakout-style game in which the player controls a paddle and attempts to break bricks with one or more
      endlessly-moving steel balls. I created it using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. I plan to add more features to the
      game in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its current stage, the game consists of the following features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A variety of screens including a main menu, an options menu, and a progress menu</li>
        <li>Eight different collectibles, which appear with a random chance upon breaking a brick and alter one of the following:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The behavior of the ball(s) currently in play</li>
          <li>The player-controlled paddle</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Five different brick types, each with varying strength and difficulty to break, one of which is unbreakable and does not count towards
          a level's brick count</li>
        <li>A total of five heart containers per level, each representing one player life; the player starts with three at the beginning of each level
          but can gain (or lose!) more by collecting life-related collectibles</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I created original sprites for the ball, paddle, bricks, hearts (player lives), and collectibles. I enjoyed being able to mesh programming and pixel
      art into an original game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been passionate about game design for as long as I can remember. I felt that creating this game would help me gain a better understanding
      of the game development process and object-oriented programming.
