    <h2>Scout Symposium: A BSA-Centered Social and Informational App</h2>
    <p>This project is still in development; the social features have not yet been implemented.</p>
    <p>Scout Symposium is a iOS app that includes both a social and informational component.
       The informational component focuses on the history of the BSA and as well as
       information about merit badges, ranks, leadership positions, popular campgrounds,
       and more. The social component, on the other hand, allows users to create their own accounts
       and interact with others inside and outside of their troop. Users can indicate their troop's
       location via Google Maps and contribute to their troop's Scout Symposium account.
